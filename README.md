## Overview
**Brute-XMLRPC** is a Python-based tool designed to perform brute force attacks on WordPress sites through the `xmlrpc.php` endpoint. It can also enumerate users via the WordPress JSON API to enhance the attack surface.

## Features
- **Multi-threaded Brute Force**: Perform brute force attacks using multiple threads for efficiency.
- **IP Spoofing**: Generate random IP addresses for headers like `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Real-IP` to enhance anonymity.
- **Custom Headers**: Use a variety of headers to mimic real-world browser requests.
- **User Enumeration**: Retrieve user information from the WordPress JSON API.
- **Interactive Input**: Easy-to-use prompts for user input and configuration.
- **Progress Display**: Real-time display of brute force attempts and progress.

## **Key Changes and Improvements:**  

1. **Proxy Handling with `aiohttp-socks`:**  
   - Integrated `aiohttp-socks` for SOCKS5 proxy support, ensuring compatibility with Tor.  
   - Replaced direct proxy arguments with `ProxyConnector` for streamlined connection management.  

2. **Enhanced Header and User-Agent Spoofing:**  
   - Expanded `user_agents` list with mobile browsers, old browsers, and bots.  
   - Broadened `referer_domains` and added randomized `Accept-Language`, `Accept-Encoding`, `Forwarded`, `DNT`, `Origin`, and `Cache-Control` headers for increased variety.  

3. **Payload Variation in `check_xmlrpc_available`:**  
   - Introduced random payloads (`system.getCapabilities`, `system.methodHelp`, etc.) for more robust testing.  

4. **Retry Logic and Rate Limiting:**  
   - Added retry mechanism with delays and handling of `429` responses using `Retry-After` header.  

5. **WAF Detection:**  
   - Added `check_for_waf` to identify 403 responses indicating a WAF and log detections in `WAF_DETECTED_LOG`.  

6. **Deprecated Method Removal:**  
   - Replaced `SocksConnector.create` with `ProxyConnector` for modern and non-deprecated proxy handling.  

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages:
  - `requests`
  - `colorama`
  - `termcolor`
  - `concurrent.futures`

You can install the required packages using the following command:
```bash

    ```

## Usage
1. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python brutecxmlrpc.py
    ```

2. Follow the prompts to:
   - Enter the target WordPress site URL.
   - Check for `xmlrpc.php` availability.
   - Choose to enumerate users via the WordPress JSON API.
   - Provide usernames and passwords manually or via files.
   - Set the number of threads for the brute force attack.
